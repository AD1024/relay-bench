# relay-bench

A repository containing examples and benchmarks for Relay.

Use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to get setup.

These benchmarks only run on Python 3.X.

## Table of Contents
- `rnn` contains various RNN based benchmarks
   used to compare against PyTorch.
- `tvm_benchmark` contains a copy of TVM's offical benchmarks
  ported to Relay, generates comparison numbers for NNVM as well.

Eventually this will contain a set of experiments for Relay.
